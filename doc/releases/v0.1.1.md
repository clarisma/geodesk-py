## Enhancements

- Creating `Coordinate` objects is now easier using `lonlat()` and `latlon()` (#10)

- Feature sets now support `__contains__` for Python's `in` operator (#23)

- Number of tags in a `Tags` object can now be obtained using `len()` 

- Partial support for `Features.tiles`

## Deprecations

- `Feature.is_placeholder` has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. 
  Missing relation members will no longer be represented by a "placeholder" feature, but
  will be omitted from the relation, and the relation will be tagged `geodesk:missing_members=yes` 

## Bug fixes

- `Features.members_of()` now properly returns an empty set if called on features that are not relations (#18)

- `Tags`: Fixed bug that caused certain tags to be skipped while iterating

## Other changes

- Maps now use the standard OSM Carto style by default (#17)

## Open issues & workarounds

- #18: Way-node retrieval may fail when querying large GOLs (16K+ tiles) that were built with 
  GOL Tool version 0.1.8 or below, due to an encoding bug in `gol build` (gol-tool#105). 
  We recommend upgrading your GOL Tool and re-building any affected GOLs.
