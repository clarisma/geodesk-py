## Breaking changes

- `Features`: Renamed filter methods (to match the naming conventions in 
   [GeoDesk for Java](https://docs.geodesk.com/java/queries#spatial-filters)):

  - `contains()` -> `containing()`

  - `intersects()` -> `intersecting()`

  - `crosses()` -> `crossing()`

## Enhancements

- Support for Python 3.13

- Support for ARM-based MacOS (experimental)
 
## Bug fixes

- `within` now correctly excludes areas whose edges lie on 
  the test area's boundary, yet are not inside the test area (#57)
  
- Removed dependency on pre-Python 3.13 API (#59)

- Formatting of numeric values in GeoJSON (#60)

- Fixed floating point conversion for strings that contain
  a partially-valid number 

- fixed `TagIterator` regression (caused by v0.1.13)
