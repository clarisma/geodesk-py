## Enhancements

- `within()`: A polygon is now considered to be *within* itself, which conforms
  to the OGC definition

## Performance Improvements

- Spatial filters that apply to large areas are now 4x to 30x faster, 
  thanks to optimizations that short-cut relatinal tests 
 
## Bug fixes

- `Features.__contains__()` now correctly uses filter bboxes

- `contains` filter properly detects edge case where a candidate polygon
  contains only a single polygon of a test multi-polygon (#31)
