## Enhancements

- `within()`: A polygon is now considered to be *within* itself, which conforms
  to the OGC definition
 
## Bug fixes

- `Features.__contains__()` now correctly uses filter bboxes

- Fixed a scaling bug that caused areas to be calculated incorrectly above 65 
  degrees latitude (#20, #32, #33)
